# Projet_Filtre

This is a project about Linear filtering in Julia realized by Harold Gallice, Colette Voisembert and Kayim Said Bacar between February and June 2017
## Subject
Study of the probablity density of the output of LTI Filter at different order with a uniform distribution as input.
* *Graphiques :* Several graphs useful for the project
* *Trace experimental :* Simulate 100 000 samples to get an experimental view of the distribution of a filter at an order k and then plot the histogram
* *y_k methodBRAD :* implémente la méthode BRAD pour générer un histogramme théorique de la repartition du filtre a l'ordre k.
Implemen ,the method to calculate the sum of uniform random variables from the article of David M. Bradley and Ramesh C. Gupta,and thus  generate  the distribution of a filtrer LTI at an order k
* *Fonctions inutilisées :* set of functions which could be used for later or other purposes or has been used and now obsolete
